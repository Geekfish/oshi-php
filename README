Lots of things to add, rewrite and improve here.
Has been tested with a simple .net client, soon to be linked here.

//   NOTES   //

Session Cookies:

Session variables are only used in this class
as the PHP SOAP server does not allow their usage in other classes
even if they are being instanciated and used within it.
Poshi mostly works as a function set to be given to server config
rather than a real class.

Clients:

All compatible clients should support cookies

Wrapper Classes:

Most of the objects used server-side cannot be directly sent to the clients
as the soap server shares both public and private properties without distinction.
Wrappers ( eg GameWrapper ) are used to expose only the desired variables while the actual
classes are only used internaly.

Caching:

Server side caching of the WSDL file has been disabled
during the project's development and testing.
A more appropriate configuration should be necessary when the project
goes in production mode.
